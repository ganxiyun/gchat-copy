# Google Chat Tweaks

This is a fork of the [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/bpatra/gchat-copy/tree/cannot_copy_threadid_link). It has been updated to function with the updated Chat PWA recently released by Google that is now more integrated an consistent with the GMail interface.

This is a chrome extension that adds a button to copy the thread link for every thread on Google Chat.
Adds a button on each message to quote reply to them.
Also hides GitHub Enterprise and Google sign-in previews since they always show up empty in google chat.
